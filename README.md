# CityModule
Modular project for cities

This project is created in order to create a collaborative work between people passionate about smart cities. I believe if we really want to go to the society we require to change the way we live. More important change our cities. 

Please feel free to share any information, open discussions projects so all of us can follow and learn more about impactful ways to improve our cities. 

## Objective
The idea with this project is to create an integrated view of the cities. Module by module will be added using a ground-based technology.

At the end we want to create a holistic view of the city, making the citizen the most important part of the city.

We aim to improve, justice, security, mobility, bureaucracy, economy, education, and more. This project is ambitious but step by step we will create awareness, innovation and new possibilities to grow as a society.

## Integration
Each module will work in a independent way, but they may be call by other modules. The black box with in the project must be designed and organized in order to obtain a coordinated way for communicate between the modules. 

Each module as basic view will call the user identification (as a first step) but it may call other modules for information. (Eg, Security may call information from customs duty, and check if everything is in order. Or Mobility could call information from Security in order to allow a car or a truck to move in certain roads)
