# CityModule
Modular Cities for a complex world

This project aims to produce collaborative work among people passionate about smart cities. We believe in the will of the citizens to change the society, and willing to work for it.

# Objective
The idea with this project is to create an integrated view of the cities. Module by module will be added using a ground-based technology.
At the end we want to create a holistic view of the city, making the citizen the most important part of the city.

We aim to improve, justice, security, mobility, bureaucracy, economy, education, and more by creating a smooth integration. This project is ambitious but step by step we will create awareness, innovation and new possibilities to grow as a society. 

## Integration
Each module will work in an independent way, but they may be called by other modules. The black box within the project must be designed and organized in order to obtain and coordinate the way communications between the modules will be performed.

Each module as the basic view will call the user identification (as a first step), but it may call other modules for information. Eg, Security may call information from customs duty, and check if everything is in order. Or Mobility could call information from Security in order to allow a car or a truck to move in certain roads)
